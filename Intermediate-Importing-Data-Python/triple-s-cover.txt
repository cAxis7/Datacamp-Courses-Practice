Dear Triple-S,

I am writing to express my interest in the programmer job opening with your insurance company. I learned about your company through friends, families and the insurance company Primerica.

I will receive my degree this June in Computer Science with approved additional courses such as undergraduate research, probability and computer vision.

After graduation, I hope to work for an agency like yours not only to grow my experience and serve clients but to also apply my insurance experience with my IT skills. In 2020, I worked as insurance sale agent with Primera as a part-time job. 

I previously work as an research assistant at my local college, working on a critical project for a client. During the research, I had the opportunity to learn more about Java development, testing, debugging and design patterns. I also learn how to visualize data for a healthcare space. I believe that my knowledge in research and insurance could be of interest of you.

I would like the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the job openings you have available. Please let me know if you have any questions. You can reach me by phone at: 787-381-7800 or by email juan.delvalle3@upr.edu

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Juan Del Valle
